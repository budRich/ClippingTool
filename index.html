		<h3>ClippingTool, the saga:</h3>

		<p>
			My dayjob consist of copy/pasting stuff from and to inputboxes. 
			Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V isn't enough, i needed more clipboards. 
			I have used various clipboard manager for personal use for years. 
			But at work i needed a clipboard manager that was more strict.
			Also, mine and many other workplaces have strict IT rules.
			To have a clipboard manager approved i had to be sure it didn't save sensetive data anywhere.</p>

		<h2>This is ClippingTool</h2>

		<p>
			First time you launch clipping tool a windo appears on the left side of the screen.
			Some inputboxes in the window is numbered 0-9.</p>

		<p>
			Box 1-9 are the clipboards for this case.
			At the top of the window is the tab bar, each tab is a case.
			Box 0 is the command box, from here you can search your notes.
			Below box 0 is the current note, to the right of that box is a filtered list of notes.</p>

			<p id="hotkeys">When ClippingTool window is active you can use the following hotkeys:</p>

		<strong>Alt+[0-9]:</strong> 
		Focus box[0-1]<br>

		<strong>Ctrl+S:</strong> 
		Save current note.<br>

		<strong>Ctrl+T:</strong> 
		New tab.<br>

		<strong>Ctrl+W:</strong> 
		Close tab.<br>

		<strong>Ctrl+[1-9]:</strong> 
		GoTo tab[1-9].<br>

		<hr>

		<p>The hotkeys described below are global and works even if ClippingTool window is hidden.</p>

		<strong>CapsLock:</strong> 
		Show/Activate ClippingTool window, if it is active, activate the previously activated window.<br>

		<strong>Ctrl+CapsLock:</strong> 
		Hide ClippingTool window.<br>

		<strong>CapsLock+[0-9]:</strong> 
		Send content of inputbox[0-9].<br>

		<strong>Shift+CapsLock+[0-9]:</strong> 
		Set content of inputbox[0-9] to selected text. <br>

		<strong>CapsLock+`:</strong> 
		Send note. <br>

		<strong>Shift+CapsLock+`:</strong> 
		Set note to selected text. <br>


		<h2>Profiles and notes</h2>

		<p>When you save a note you can choose to make it either global or local.</p>

		<p>If it's local it will be saved in ClippingTool\profiles\%profile%\%folder%\%note% .
			%profile% %folder% and %note% is set by you. Locally saved notes can only be viewed when it's corresponding profile is open.</p>

		<p>If it's global it will be saved in ClippingTool\global\%folder%\%note% . 
			%folder% and %note% is set by you. Global notes can be accessed from any profile.</p>

		<p>If a note contains a string thats equal to a box, it will be converted to a template when saved. This means when saving 
			a note that includes "LeifLoket", that happens to be whats in box2, in this profile: username. Next time this template 
			is loaded, the value of username will be where the original note said: "LeifLoket". </p>

		<p>A profile is basicly a list of what boxes is to be visible in the window.</p>

		<p>This is how you create a profile:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a folder in ClippingTool\profiles\ , the name of the folder is the name of the profile.</li>
			<li>Create a file named list in this folder.</li>
			<li>Every line in list, is the name of the corresponding input box.</li>
			<li>You can set the current profile from the window menu.</li>
			<li>Hold shift when you create a new tab, to choose profile for the tab.</li>
		</ul>		

		<h2>Drag for more boxes</h2>

		<p>You can drag "~~~~~~~~~~~~~" down if you need more boxes.</p>

		<h2>ClippingTool is free</h2>
